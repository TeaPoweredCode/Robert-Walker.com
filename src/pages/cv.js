          <EmploymentPlace place="reach." site="reachstudios.co.uk" siteUrl="https://reachstudios.co.uk/" time="June 2023 - January 2024" jobTitle="Senior Developer">
            <p>              
              Primarily employed as PHP Developer I worked on a number of projects using the Tall (Tailwind, Alpine.js, Laravel, and Livewire) stack.
              Working closely with clients, I helped both to build projects from their start; as well as sustaining ongoing development and maintenance of projects that were already deployed.
              Where possible I have also helped fellow developers working in the other disciplines that the company offered, such as mobile development aiding with flutter projects. 
            </p>
            <p>                            
              Another part of my role as a Senior Developer was to support, train and further educate the company's apprentices,
              with focus on helping them to develop their skills and understanding of core programming concepts.

          <EmploymentPlace place="GWD" site="gwd.team" siteUrl="https://gwd.team/" time="June 2021 - January 2023" jobTitle="Software Engineer">
            <p>              
              GWD prides its self on helping socially-minded organisations and charities transition to digital systems.
              While at this company my primary role was to work on the company's main two products the "Donation Station" a contactless fundraising system 
              and the "Discovery Station" a self-service library kiosk. Both applications were written as react apps that then use NW.js to package them for Windows desktop.
            </p>
            <p>                            
              The other aspect of GWD platform is the "Device Service", a C# application which runs as a web service that creates api endpoints that are used by the
              Donation Station and Discovery Station to interact with different hardware. For this I implemented a new card payment systems, as well as improving
              the performance of cash acceptors, rfid tag readers and barcode readers.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also expanded the product range, developing  the new "Experiential Giving" system, a companion product for the Donation Station.
              Designed to help drive engagement and visibility. Experiential Giving couples a large video display with the Donation Station tablet.
              As a user moves though the steps of making a donation, different pages trigger events on the large screen creating interactions and rewards.
              The system uses a node server and websockets to allow the tablet and device running the video display to communicate.

            <p>
              During my time with Pryors I worked on a wide range of projects.
              My main task was to develop a Windows desktop application "Traceable-IT", a complex marking and traceability package written in C# and VB.
			        I was responsible for the implementing of new core features, integrating new hardware such as ABB Robots , RFID readers and Cognex vision systems. 
			        I also worked closely with clients such as Rolls Royce and Jaguar Land Rover to create custom modules and bespoke solitons.
			        For the last two years with the company I headed development of the next generation of traceability software for distribution in the Us.

            {/*
             <p>
              Secondly with my background in web development I was tasked with developing of a range a web sites. These have included;
              A ticketing and project management tool, sites for manage language translations and documentation for the desktop apps, 
              web apis for tracking parts in manufacturing plants. The latest site I worked on was a software licence keys management.
            </p> 
            */}
            <p>
              Due to my enthusiasm for exploring different technologies I was often given any project that fell outside the standard skill set of the team. 
			        This led to me developing an number of Android application including a government contract to help prevent metal theft,
              an RFID tag reading application that runs on Windows pocket PCs for JLR and  
              building a "Pick-To-Light" system using Arduinos and neo pixel LEDs to aid in the assembly of machines.

            <p>
              During our placement year at Sheffield Hallam, a friend and I took advantage of the university's enterprise scheme and started our own company. 
              IOAIS was a web design and software development company we ran for 15 months where we sourced and maintained contact with a small number of clients,
              as well working on a range of internal projects.
            </p> 
            <p>
              Apart from improving my design and development skills, I also learnt a significant amount about running a business learning from both our successes and our failures.
              We became versed in; finding and managing clients, gathering specifications, managing expectations and the general client communication. 
              These are skills I've been able to apply directly in my later career. I've also been able to share the business knowledge that I gained with a number of friends 
              who have gone onto set up their own businesses or go self-employed.
